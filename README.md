TEC-1 cosmic ray detector



Cosmic-ray observatories are designed to detect and study high-energy particles that originate from outside of the Earth's atmosphere. These particles, known as cosmic rays, can include a wide range of particles such as photons, electrons, protons, and nuclei of heavier elements, as well as antimatter particles. They are typically detected using a variety of instruments such as particle detectors, telescopes, and radio antennas. The data collected by these observatories can be used to study a wide range of phenomena in astrophysics and particle physics, including the properties of the sources of cosmic rays, the nature of the interstellar medium, and the properties of the particles themselves.
